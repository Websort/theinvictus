                he possesses a significant quantity of information and
                experience pertaining to the field of abroad education and the

                the divide that exists between the students and the
                consultancies, he came to the conclusion that there is a need to
                bridge the divide by offering the students with services that
                are targeted to their specific needs, need-based, one-on-one,
                and of a high quality. He is an expert in the application and
                visa procedures for over 15 countries throughout the world, some

                the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, the Netherlands, and
                Sweden, amongst others. Over the course of his work, he takes
                great pride in having successfully placed more than 6,000
                students in a wide range of nations all over the world.
